        <h4>Keila Davies, DPT</h4>
        <p>With a passion for caring for others since a very young age, I followed my call and dedicated my whole academic journey to biological and medical sciences. With a great interest in the kinesiology field, I pursued the path of Physical Therapy studies, achieving a Doctorate Degree from the University of Michigan in 2015 after a long journey of academic accomplishments since my first undergraduate degree.</p>
        <p>At a very young age, I was a witness to the limitations of Western medicine when my own health issues took an unexpected turn as I was first introduced to natural medicine. I am a living testimony to the power of functional, integrative, homeopathic, and naturopathic approaches to health.</p>
        <p>Since my early experiences with natural healing, a deep understanding of traditional medicine, and more than 2 decades of practicing as a healthcare professional, I have committed to a holistic way to address patients' conditions and concerns.</p>
        <p>In the past 8 years, my dedication shifted to clinical research and wellness coaching as I constantly witness the difference in results that functional and integrative medicine has throughout patients' health journeys.</p>
        <p>Working with clinical trials in one of the largest health institutions in San Diego gives me a differentiated ability to see what works in terms of treatments and clinical approaches.</p>
        <p>I can balance my academic background, work experience, and day-to-day encounters with patients to formulate solutions based not only on science but on the real-world perspective I experience daily in my professional practice.</p>
        <p>Specializing in children's and women's health, chronic conditions, respiratory therapy, neurodevelopmental conditions, exercise therapy, facial and body rejuvenation, and other specialties, I educate patients on innate healing processes and offer a range of treatments, including pain management, health coaching, nutrition and supplement counseling, exercise guidance, body contouring, and anti-aging modalities.</p>
        <p>I advocate for an integrative healthcare approach and collaborate with other medical and allied health professionals, blending scientific knowledge with modern biomedical evidence to provide optimal patient care.</p>
