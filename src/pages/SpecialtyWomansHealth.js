        <h1>Women's Health</h1>
        <p>Integrative women's health aims to support women with tools that can cover the whole spectrum of their healthcare needs.</p>
        <p>An integrative approach may incorporate pharmaceuticals, herbal medicine, physical medicine, supplementation, and mental health support.</p>
        <p>We provide a comprehensive range of integrative treatments and therapies for women, including:</p>
        <p>Comprehensive evaluation — On our first consultation, we will discuss about your symptoms, health history, lifestyle and current health issues and elaborate an individualized plan of treatment.</p>
        <p>Herbal medicine — Treatments derived from plants can be used to help treat or prevent illness.</p>
        <p>Nutrition counseling – We will evaluate your diet and design a comprehensive meal plan to improve your health and prevent diseases.</p>
        <p>Nutritional supplements — We will guide you through the supplements that may be beneficial to you, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other nutrients to address specific health problems.</p>
        <p>Exercise counseling – offering personalized exercise programs to help you improve strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance. Managing your progress with individualized and tailored criteria. Focusing on wellbeing and longevity, rather than repetitions and strenuous activities.</p>
